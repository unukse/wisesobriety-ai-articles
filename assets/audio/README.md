# Meditation Audio Files

This directory contains the meditation audio files that come pre-installed with the app.

## Required Files

Add the following MP3 files to this directory:

### Default File Names (for bundled audio):
1. `morning-calm.mp3` - 5-minute morning meditation
2. `stress-relief.mp3` - 10-minute stress relief meditation  
3. `deep-breathing.mp3` - 3-minute breathing exercise
4. `recovery-focus.mp3` - 15-minute recovery-focused meditation
5. `sleep-well.mp3` - 20-minute sleep meditation
6. `gratitude-practice.mp3` - 8-minute gratitude meditation
7. `slow-down.mp3` - Slow down meditation for finding center
8. `belly-breathing.mp3` - Deep belly breathing exercise for relaxation
9. `inner-stillness.mp3` - Meditation for finding inner stillness and peace

### Custom File Names (for user imports):
1. `my-morning-meditation.mp3` - 5-minute morning meditation
2. `my-stress-relief.mp3` - 10-minute stress relief meditation  
3. `my-breathing-exercise.mp3` - 3-minute breathing exercise
4. `my-recovery-meditation.mp3` - 15-minute recovery-focused meditation
5. `my-sleep-meditation.mp3` - 20-minute sleep meditation
6. `my-gratitude-meditation.mp3` - 8-minute gratitude meditation

## File Requirements

- **Format**: MP3
- **Size**: Up to 50MB per file (recommended: 10-20MB for good quality)
- **Quality**: 128-320 kbps recommended
- **Duration**: Match the durations specified in the meditation sessions

## How It Works

1. **Pre-installed**: Default files are bundled with the app and available immediately
2. **Custom Override**: Users can import files with custom names to replace the defaults
3. **Fallback**: If no custom file exists, the app uses the bundled version
4. **Flexible Naming**: You can use either default or custom file names

## Adding Your Files

### For Bundled Audio (Default):
1. Place your MP3 files in this directory
2. Name them exactly as listed in "Default File Names"
3. The app will automatically detect and use them

### For Custom User Imports:
1. Users can import files with custom names
2. Custom names are shown in the Audio Import screen
3. Users rename their files to match the custom names

## Note

These files will increase the app bundle size, so keep them reasonably sized while maintaining good audio quality.
