# RLS Authentication Fix

## Why RLS Being Disabled Causes the Error

You're absolutely correct! The error `Cannot read property 'id' of null` is likely caused by RLS being disabled on the `check_ins` table.

## The Problem

When RLS is **disabled**:
- ✅ Database allows any user to insert data
- ✅ No authentication required at database level
- ❌ **App still tries to get authenticated user ID**
- ❌ **Creates mismatch between app and database**

## The Solution

When RLS is **enabled with proper policies**:
- ✅ Database requires authentication
- ✅ App must provide valid user ID
- ✅ Authentication flow works correctly
- ✅ User ID validation happens properly

## How to Fix

### Step 1: Enable RLS
Run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE check_ins ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own check-ins" ON check_ins
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own check-ins" ON check_ins
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own check-ins" ON check_ins
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own check-ins" ON check_ins
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Step 2: Test the Fix
1. Run the SQL above
2. Go back to your app
3. Try submitting a check-in
4. The authentication error should be gone!

## Why This Works

**Before (RLS Disabled):**
- App tries to get user ID for authentication
- Database doesn't require authentication
- Mismatch causes null user errors

**After (RLS Enabled):**
- App gets user ID for authentication
- Database requires valid user ID
- Authentication flow works correctly

## Verification

After enabling RLS, you should see:
- ✅ No more "Cannot read property 'id' of null" errors
- ✅ Check-ins save successfully
- ✅ User authentication works properly
- ✅ Data is properly secured

The RLS fix should resolve the authentication error completely!
