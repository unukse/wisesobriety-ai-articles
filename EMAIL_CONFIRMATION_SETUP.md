# Email Confirmation HTML Setup Guide

## Overview
Your app now uses a simple HTML page for email confirmation instead of deep links. When users click the confirmation link in their email, they'll see a beautiful success page and can then open your app.

## How It Works

1. **User signs up** in your app
2. **Supabase sends confirmation email** with link to HTML page
3. **User clicks email link** → opens HTML confirmation page
4. **User sees success message** and can open your app
5. **User opens app** and can sign in with confirmed account

## Files Created

### `email-confirmed.html`
- Beautiful, responsive confirmation page
- Matches your app's design (gradient background, colors)
- Includes buttons to open your app or visit website
- Auto-redirects to app after 5 seconds on mobile
- Works on all devices (desktop, mobile, tablet)

## Configuration

### 1. Update AuthContext
The signup function now redirects to:
```javascript
emailRedirectTo: 'https://wisesobriety.org/email-confirmed.html'
```

### 2. Host the HTML Page
You need to host the `email-confirmed.html` file on your domain. Options:

#### Option A: GitHub Pages (Free)
1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Upload `email-confirmed.html` to the repository
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
4. Update the redirect URL to your GitHub Pages URL

#### Option B: Your Own Domain
1. Upload `email-confirmed.html` to your web server
2. Make sure it's accessible at `https://wisesobriety.org/email-confirmed.html`
3. Update the redirect URL if needed

#### Option C: Netlify/Vercel (Free)
1. Create a new project
2. Upload `email-confirmed.html`
3. Deploy and get a URL like `https://your-project.netlify.app/email-confirmed.html`
4. Update the redirect URL

## Testing

### Method 1: Local Testing
1. Host the HTML file locally or on a temporary server
2. Update the `emailRedirectTo` URL in AuthContext
3. Test signup flow
4. Check that the confirmation page loads correctly

### Method 2: Production Testing
1. Deploy the HTML file to your domain
2. Test the complete signup flow
3. Verify the confirmation page works on all devices

## Customization

### Update the HTML Page
You can customize the `email-confirmed.html` page:

- **Colors**: Update the gradient colors to match your brand
- **Text**: Change the success message and descriptions
- **Buttons**: Modify the button text and links
- **Logo**: Add your app logo to the page
- **Auto-redirect**: Adjust the 5-second delay or remove it

### Update Redirect URL
If you change the hosting location, update this line in `src/contexts/AuthContext.js`:
```javascript
emailRedirectTo: 'https://your-new-domain.com/email-confirmed.html'
```
