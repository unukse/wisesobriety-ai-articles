# AI Summary Fix

## Current Error
```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of null
```

This error occurs during AI summary generation after the check-in is successfully saved.

## Quick Fix

### Option 1: Skip AI Summary (Temporary)
1. Go to `src/screens/CheckInScreen.js`
2. Find the AI summary generation code (around line 230)
3. Comment out or remove the AI summary generation temporarily
4. Test the check-in - it should work without AI summary

### Option 2: Fix AI Summary Function
The issue is in `src/lib/ai-summary.js`. The function is trying to access `session.user.id` when `session.user` might be null.

## Root Cause
- Check-in saves successfully (RLS is working)
- AI summary generation fails because session user is null
- This happens because the session might be stale or not properly established

## Immediate Solution
1. **Test without AI summary first** - make sure check-ins work
2. **Then we can fix the AI summary** - it's not critical for basic functionality

## Expected Behavior
After the fix:
- ✅ Check-ins save successfully
- ✅ No more null user errors
- ✅ Success message appears
- ⚠️ AI summary might be skipped (temporarily)

The check-in functionality should work perfectly once we handle the AI summary error!
