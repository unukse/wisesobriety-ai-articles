For social situations, practice saying 'I'm not drinking tonight' with confidence. Consider joining a local AA meeting or sober social group to build your support network. Your honesty about having a little alcohol shows self-awareness - tomorrow is a fresh start. You've got this!"

For boredom, create a list of engaging activities you can turn to immediately. For anxiety, try the 4-7-8 breathing technique: inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8.
