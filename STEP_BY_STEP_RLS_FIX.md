CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own check-ins" ON check_ins
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own check-ins" ON check_ins
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own check-ins" ON check_ins
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own check-ins" ON check_ins
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## âœ… Success Indicators
