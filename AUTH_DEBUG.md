# Authentication Debug Guide

## Current Error
```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of null
```

This error indicates that `session.user` is null, which means the user session is not properly established.

## Debug Steps

### Step 1: Check Console Logs
When you try to submit a check-in, look for the debug output that starts with:
```
=== AUTH DEBUG ===
```

This will show:
- AuthContext user object
- Session object
- Session user object
- Any session errors

### Step 2: Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Session is null
**Symptoms**: `Session: null` in debug output
**Solution**: 
1. Sign out of the app
2. Sign back in
3. Try the check-in again

#### Issue 2: Session exists but user is null
**Symptoms**: `Session user: null` in debug output
**Solution**:
1. The session might be corrupted
2. Sign out and sign back in
3. If that doesn't work, clear app data and sign in again

#### Issue 3: User exists but ID is missing
**Symptoms**: `Session user.id: undefined` in debug output
**Solution**:
1. This is a rare Supabase issue
2. Try refreshing the session manually
3. Sign out and sign back in

### Step 3: Manual Session Refresh
If the above doesn't work, try this in your app:

1. Go to the Check-in screen
2. Open the browser console (if testing on web)
3. Run this command:
```javascript
// Refresh the session manually
await supabase.auth.refreshSession();
```

### Step 4: Test Authentication
Run this test to verify authentication is working:

```javascript
// Test authentication status
const { data: { session }, error } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
console.log('Session:', session);
console.log('User:', session?.user);
console.log('User ID:', session?.user?.id);
```

## Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Sign Out and Back In
1. Go to your app
2. Sign out completely
3. Sign back in with your credentials
4. Try the check-in again

### Fix 2: Clear App Data
1. Close the app completely
2. Clear app data/cache
3. Reopen the app
4. Sign in again
5. Try the check-in

### Fix 3: Check Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Check Authentication â†’ Users
3. Verify your user account exists and is confirmed
4. If not confirmed, check your email for confirmation

### Fix 4: Test with Simple Check-in
Try submitting a minimal check-in with just required fields:
- Emotional state: "Good"
- Alcohol consumption: "No"

## Expected Debug Output

When authentication is working correctly, you should see:
```
=== AUTH DEBUG ===
AuthContext user: {id: "uuid-here", email: "user@example.com", ...}
AuthContext user.id: "uuid-here"
Session: {user: {id: "uuid-here", email: "user@example.com", ...}, ...}
Session user: {id: "uuid-here", email: "user@example.com", ...}
Session user.id: "uuid-here"
Session error: null
=== END AUTH DEBUG ===
```

## If Still Getting Errors

1. **Check the exact debug output** and share it
2. **Verify your Supabase project** is active and accessible
3. **Check your API keys** are correct in `src/lib/supabase.js`
4. **Try the emergency RLS fix** if authentication is working but RLS is still blocking

The authentication error should be resolved once the session is properly established!
